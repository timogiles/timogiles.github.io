Matthew 6:28   And why worry about your clothes? Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing,
Matthew 6:29   yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.
Matthew 6:30   And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and gone tomorrow, won't he more surely care for you? You have so little faith!

Matthew 6:32   Why be like the pagans who are so deeply concerned about these things? Your heavenly Father already knows all your needs,
Matthew 6:33   and he will give you all you need from day to day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your primary concern.
Matthew 6:34   So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.
