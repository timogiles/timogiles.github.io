Acts 2:1   On the day of Pentecost, seven weeks after Jesus' resurrection, the believers were meeting together in one place.
Acts 2:2   Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm in the skies above them, and it filled the house where they were meeting.
Acts 2:3   Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them.
Acts 2:4   And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.

Acts 2:18   In those days I will pour out my Spirit upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy.
Acts 2:19   And I will cause wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below--blood and fire and clouds of smoke.

Acts 2:24   However, God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back to life again, for death could not keep him in its grip.
Acts 2:25   King David said this about him: 'I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.

1 Corinthians 12:7   A spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church.
1 Corinthians 12:8   To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another he gives the gift of special knowledge.
1 Corinthians 12:9   The Spirit gives special faith to another, and to someone else he gives the power to heal the sick.
1 Corinthians 12:10   He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and to another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to know whether it is really the Spirit of God or another spirit that is speaking. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages, and another is given the ability to interpret what is being said.
1 Corinthians 12:11   It is the one and only Holy Spirit who distributes these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.

1 Corinthians 12:14   Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part.
1 Corinthians 12:15   If the foot says, I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand, that does not make it any less a part of the body.
1 Corinthians 12:16   And if the ear says, I am not part of the body because I am only an ear and not an eye, would that make it any less a part of the body?
1 Corinthians 12:17   Suppose the whole body were an eye--then how would you hear? Or if your whole body were just one big ear, how could you smell anything?
1 Corinthians 12:18   But God made our bodies with many parts, and he has put each part just where he wants it.
1 Corinthians 12:19   What a strange thing a body would be if it had only one part!
1 Corinthians 12:20   Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.
1 Corinthians 12:21   The eye can never say to the hand, I don't need you. The head can't say to the feet, I don't need you.
1 Corinthians 12:22   In fact, some of the parts that seem weakest and least important are really the most necessary.
1 Corinthians 12:23   And the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect from the eyes of others those parts that should not be seen,
1 Corinthians 12:24   while other parts do not require this special care. So God has put the body together in such a way that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity.
1 Corinthians 12:25   This makes for harmony among the members, so that all the members care for each other equally.
1 Corinthians 12:26   If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad.

1 Corinthians 14:3   But one who prophesies is helping others grow in the Lord, encouraging and comforting them.
1 Corinthians 14:4   A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally in the Lord, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.

1 Corinthians 14:5   I wish you all had the gift of speaking in tongues, but even more I wish you were all able to prophesy. For prophecy is a greater and more useful gift than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church can get some good out of it.
1 Corinthians 14:6   Dear brothers and sisters, if I should come to you talking in an unknown language, how would that help you? But if I bring you some revelation or some special knowledge or some prophecy or some teaching--that is what will help you.
1 Corinthians 14:7   Even musical instruments like the flute or the harp, though they are lifeless, are examples of the need for speaking in plain language. For no one will recognize the melody unless the notes are played clearly.

1 Corinthians 14:18   I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
1 Corinthians 14:19   But in a church meeting I would much rather speak five understandable words that will help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.

1 Corinthians 14:20   Dear brothers and sisters, don't be childish in your understanding of these things. Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature and wise in understanding matters of this kind.
1 Corinthians 14:21   It is written in the Scriptures, I will speak to my own people through unknown languages and through the lips of foreigners. But even then, they will not listen to me, says the Lord.

1 Corinthians 14:22   So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers.
1 Corinthians 14:23   Even so, if unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your meeting and hear everyone talking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy.
1 Corinthians 14:24   But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin, and they will be condemned by what you say.
1 Corinthians 14:25   As they listen, their secret thoughts will be laid bare, and they will fall down on their knees and worship God, declaring, God is really here among you.

1 Corinthians 14:26   Well, my brothers and sisters, let's summarize what I am saying. When you meet, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in an unknown language, while another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must be useful to all and build them up in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:27   No more than two or three should speak in an unknown language. They must speak one at a time, and someone must be ready to interpret what they are saying.
1 Corinthians 14:28   But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately.

1 Corinthians 14:29   Let two or three prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said.
1 Corinthians 14:30   But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop.
1 Corinthians 14:31   In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged.
1 Corinthians 14:32   Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can wait their turn.
1 Corinthians 14:33   For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the other churches.

1 Corinthians 14:34   Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says.
1 Corinthians 14:35   If they have any questions to ask, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.

1 Corinthians 14:36   Do you think that the knowledge of God's word begins and ends with you Corinthians? Well, you are mistaken!
1 Corinthians 14:37   If you claim to be a prophet or think you are very spiritual, you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself.
1 Corinthians 14:38   But if you do not recognize this, you will not be recognized.
