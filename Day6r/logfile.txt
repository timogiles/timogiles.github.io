Psalms 1:1   Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with scoffers.
Psalms 1:2   But they delight in doing everything the LORD wants; day and night they think about his law.
Psalms 1:3   They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season without fail. Their leaves never wither, and in all they do, they prosper.

Hosea 4:6   My people are being destroyed because they don't know me. It is all your fault, you priests, for you yourselves refuse to know me. Now I refuse to recognize you as my priests. Since you have forgotten the laws of your God, I will forget to bless your children.

Galatians 5:16   So I advise you to live according to your new life in the Holy Spirit. Then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves.
Galatians 5:17   The old sinful nature loves to do evil, which is just opposite from what the Holy Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are opposite from what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, and your choices are never free from this conflict.
Galatians 5:18   But when you are directed by the Holy Spirit, you are no longer subject to the law.

Galatians 5:19   When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, your lives will produce these evil results: sexual immorality, impure thoughts, eagerness for lustful pleasure,
Galatians 5:20   idolatry, participation in demonic activities, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, divisions, the feeling that everyone is wrong except those in your own little group,
Galatians 5:21   envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other kinds of sin. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.

1 Peter 2:4   Come to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God's temple. He was rejected by the people, but he is precious to God who chose him.
1 Peter 2:5   And now God is building you, as living stones, into his spiritual temple. What's more, you are God's holy priests, who offer the spiritual sacrifices that please him because of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 2:6   As the Scriptures express it, I am placing a stone in Jerusalem, a chosen cornerstone, and anyone who believes in him will never be disappointed. 
1 Peter 2:7   Yes, he is very precious to you who believe. But for those who reject him, The stone that was rejected by the builders has now become the cornerstone.
1 Peter 2:8   And the Scriptures also say, He is the stone that makes people stumble, the rock that will make them fall. They stumble because they do not listen to God's word or obey it, and so they meet the fate that has been planned for them.

1 Peter 2:10   Once you were not a people; now you are the people of God. Once you received none of God's mercy; now you have received his mercy.

1 Peter 2:13   For the Lord's sake, accept all authority--the king as head of state,
1 Peter 2:14   and the officials he has appointed. For the king has sent them to punish all who do wrong and to honor those who do right.
1 Peter 2:15   It is God's will that your good lives should silence those who make foolish accusations against you.
1 Peter 2:16   You are not slaves; you are free. But your freedom is not an excuse to do evil. You are free to live as God's slaves.
