Romans 12:4   Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function,
Romans 12:5   so it is with Christ's body. We are all parts of his one body, and each of us has different work to do. And since we are all one body in Christ, we belong to each other, and each of us needs all the others.
Romans 12:6   God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out when you have faith that God is speaking through you.
Romans 12:7   If your gift is that of serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, do a good job of teaching.
Romans 12:8   If your gift is to encourage others, do it! If you have money, share it generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.
Romans 12:9   Don't just pretend that you love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of the good.
Romans 12:10   Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other.

Romans 12:14   If people persecute you because you are a Christian, don't curse them; pray that God will bless them.
Romans 12:15   When others are happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, share their sorrow.
