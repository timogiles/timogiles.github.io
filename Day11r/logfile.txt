Mark 2:8   Jesus knew what they were discussing among themselves, so he said to them, Why do you think this is blasphemy?
Mark 2:9   Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven' or 'Get up, pick up your mat, and walk'?
Mark 2:10   I will prove that I, the Son of Man, have the authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said,
Mark 2:11   Stand up, take your mat, and go on home, because you are healed!
Mark 2:12   The man jumped up, took the mat, and pushed his way through the stunned onlookers. Then they all praised God. We've never seen anything like this before! they exclaimed.

Mark 5:26   She had suffered a great deal from many doctors through the years and had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she was worse.
Mark 5:27   She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched the fringe of his robe.
Mark 5:28   For she thought to herself, If I can just touch his clothing, I will be healed.
Mark 5:29   Immediately the bleeding stopped, and she could feel that she had been healed!

Mark 5:32   But he kept on looking around to see who had done it.
Mark 5:33   Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and told him what she had done.

Mark 5:37   Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter and James and John.
Mark 5:38   When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the weeping and wailing.
Mark 5:39   He went inside and spoke to the people. Why all this weeping and commotion? he asked. The child isn't dead; she is only asleep.

John 9:1   As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.
John 9:2   Teacher, his disciples asked him, why was this man born blind? Was it a result of his own sins or those of his parents?
John 9:3   It was not because of his sins or his parents' sins, Jesus answered. He was born blind so the power of God could be seen in him.
John 9:4   All of us must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent me, because there is little time left before the night falls and all work comes to an end.
John 9:5   But while I am still here in the world, I am the light of the world.
John 9:6   Then he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and smoothed the mud over the blind man's eyes.
John 9:7   He told him, Go and wash in the pool of Siloam (Siloam means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing!
